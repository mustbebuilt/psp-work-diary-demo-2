# Guide to Recording Your Contribution to the Teams

To monitor your contribution to your team you will require to maintain a GitHub repo dedicated to the task.

This should be a private repo with your academic consultant as the only contributor.

You should make weekly updates during the week upto and between Sprints and daily updates durng the Sprint Weeks themselves.

Updates will take the form of a pull request and should be written as a markdown file [see guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

> [!TIP]
> The repo will allow the academic team to see that you have contributed consistently throughout the project via timestamped pull requests.  You should ensure you complete these regularly in order to evidence your contribution to the team.  This will contribute to your mark in both the tasks that make up the assignment.

4. Provide a descriptive title for your pull request.
5. In the description, include the following details:
   - **What you did during this duration of the session.**
   - **What you intend to do before the next session.**
   - **Any issues arising and how you intend to resolve them.**
6. Your can choose to create a folder which matches the branch name to add additional evidence such as project specifications, user stories, wireframe etc.

## **Step 8: Review Feedback**
Once your academic consultant has reviewed your Pull Request, they may make comments:
1. Review their comments.
2. Respond to comments where appropriate.
3. Commit and push the updates to the same branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Chore: Address reviewer comments"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
4. The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.
